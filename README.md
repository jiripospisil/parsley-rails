# Parsley.js for Rails Asset Pipeline

[Parsley.js](https://github.com/guillaumepotier/Parsley.js) is an awesome form validation library ([documentation](http://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html)).
This gem makes it easy to use it with Rails Asset Pipeline.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "parsley-rails"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Add the following to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

    //= require jquery
    //= require parsley

To use the `remote` library or a different i18n, add this right after:

    //= require parsley.remote
    //= require parsley.i18n.fr
    
*Note that 'ru' (russian) localisation should ends with '.js' (`//= require parsley.i18n.ru.js`) to prevent [parsing error](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/issues/529)*

Finally, if you want to use the default CSS, add the following to your
`app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

    *= require parsley
