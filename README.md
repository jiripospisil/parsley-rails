# Parsley.js for Rails Asset Pipeline

[Parsley.js](https://github.com/guillaumepotier/Parsley.js) is an awesome form validation library ([documentation](http://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html)).
This gem makes it easy to use it with Rails Asset Pipeline.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "parsley-rails"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Add the following to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

    //= require jquery
    //= require parsley

To use a different i18n, add this right after:

    //= require parsley.i18n.fr
    
Note that 'ru' (russian) localisation should ends with '.js' (`//= require parsley.i18n.ru.js`) to prevent [parsing error](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets/issues/529).

Finally, if you want to use the default CSS, add the following to your
`app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

    *= require parsley

## Sass Support

If you prefer SCSS, add this to your application.css.scss file:

    @import 'parsley';

If you use the Sass indented syntax, add this to your application.css.sass file:

    @import parsley

See the complete [Parsley.js documentation](http://parsleyjs.org/doc/index.html).

## Versions

The gem follows Parsley.js' versions. If the gem's version is `2.0.0.0`, then `2.0.0` is a version of Parsley.js and `0`

Note that there's a script (./update.sh 2.6.5) for automatic update from the
official distribution. Unfortunately the files in the "extras" are not part of
the distribution and thus are not transpiled. And since I'm too lazy to
reliably script it, it's necessary to modify some of the files (`comparison.js`
as of now) and remove the offending lines.
